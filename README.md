# piSparc
A 3D printable recreation of a Sun SparcStation IPX, designed to fit a Raspberry Pi

### BOM
To build the basic case you need:
- 1 x Top
- 1 x Bottom
- 4 x Leg
- Raspberry Pi
- 4 x M2 screw

If you want to use the case latches you will also need
- 2 x Case-Button
- 2 x Case-Latch
- 2 x 0.5 x 6 x 3mm Compression Spring
- 2 x M2 screw

If you don't have an AMS printer or want to print the case badges separately then you will also need:
- 1 x SparcStation Logo
- 1 x Sun Logo

### External Ports
You can also use external ports for the USB ports and Ethernet ports
- 1 x Panel Mount Ethernet Port https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B092DR5H53
- 1 x Panel Mount Dual USB Ports https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08T8J94RS
- 1 x Panel Mount Single USB Port (for front mounted USB) https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07BPDSFJY

### Instructions
#### Bottom
- Screw Raspberry Pi into bottom
- If using external ports, connect them now
#### Top
- Place 1 x Case Latch one of the latch pillers with the clip facing outwards
- Put a spring onto a Case-Button stem, push it through the clip hole from the outside. Use an M2 screw to connect the Latch to the Button
- Repeat for the other side
- Screw the dual USB port into the top case, it uses the larger hole at the back of the top case.
- Screw the Ethernet socket into the hole next to it.
- If using the front USB socket you can screw this in the front of the top case.
#### Putting it together
- angle the top case so the clips do into the holes on the bottom case
- Close the case, you may need to push the clips in to get the case to close. The two sides will be quite close in size so will need some aligning to close.
#### Finishing touches
Push the legs into the bottom holes, if they're too loose you can use an M3 screw to hold them in
